Now add breads one by one to the oil and press to deep into the oil till it gets a ball shape by a spatula or spud. Turn the other side and fry till it turns brown. Remember not to fry for long time that can make them hard or crispy. Use a strainer to release extra oil and remove more oil using kitchen tissue before serve. Serve warm with meat or vegetables."
